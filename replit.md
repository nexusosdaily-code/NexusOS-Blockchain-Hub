# NexusOS Civilization Operating System

## Overview
NexusOS is a civilization architecture replacing traditional binary computation with electromagnetic wave states and basing economics on quantum energy (E=hf). Its core purpose is to build a self-sustaining, physics-based civilization that guarantees basic living standards through a Basic Human Living Standards (BHLS) floor system, ensuring prosperity and stability for all citizens. A key feature is the Economic Loop System, a 5-milestone economic architecture where messaging burns create economic value through orbital transitions, DEX liquidity allocation, supply chain monetization, community ownership, and crisis protection.

## User Preferences
-   **Communication Style**: Simple, everyday language
-   **Technical Approach**: Physics-first, quantum-inspired economics
-   **Architecture**: Wavelength-based validation over traditional cryptographic hashing
-   **Licensing**: GPL v3 (GNU General Public License v3.0) to ensure community ownership and prevent corporate exploitation

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The system provides a Unified Dashboard Launcher (`app.py`) offering access to multiple modules. The **Mobile Blockchain Hub** (`mobile_blockchain_hub.py`) serves as the central blockchain interface, integrating all core blockchain operations into a unified mobile-first application including a Web3 Wallet, Mobile DAG Messaging, Blockchain Explorer, DEX, Validator Economics, Wavelength Economics, Network modules, Civic Governance, and Mobile Connectivity.

### Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications

-   **WNSP v4.0 Protocol (Quantum Entanglement Consensus)**: Advanced consensus layer using Bell's theorem and EPR pairs for Byzantine-fault-tolerant validation. Features Proof of Entanglement consensus (50% fault tolerance vs 33% in v3), instant 10ms confirmation times (vs 5s in v3), entanglement-swapping relay nodes, temporal entanglement for historical validation, and full integration with Environmental Energy Harvester and Quantum Randomness systems. Backward compatible with v3.0; available as standalone module (`wnsp_quantum_entanglement_poc.py`) for optional deployment.
-   **WNSP Unified Mesh Stack**: A 4-layer decentralized knowledge infrastructure integrating Community Mesh ISP, Censorship-Resistant Routing, Privacy-First Messaging, and Offline Knowledge Networks. It enables internet-independent communication with wavelength-based addressing, quantum-encrypted P2P messaging, and distributed Wikipedia caching.
-   **WNSP Media Propagation Engine (Complete Architecture)**: Full content distribution architecture for media types (MP3/MP4/PDF/images/software) across mesh using 64KB chunking, mesh-aware routing, progressive streaming, content hashing, and multi-hop E=hf energy accounting.
-   **WNSP Live Streaming (WebRTC + E=hf Integration)**: Real-time peer-to-peer video/audio broadcasting system with quantum energy cost enforcement via a two-phase E=hf transaction system, WebRTC signaling, and friend-only privacy.
-   **WNSP P2P Hub - Phone Number Authentication (PROTOTYPE/DEMO ONLY)**: Phone number-based authentication system for P2P broadcasting and content sharing. **CRITICAL SECURITY LIMITATION**: Current implementation accepts client-sent phone numbers WITHOUT SMS verification.
-   **Wavelength-Economic Validation System**: A physics-based blockchain validation system utilizing Maxwell equation solvers, wave superposition, and 5D wave signature validation.

-   **DEX (Decentralized Exchange)**: A Layer 2 Automated Market Maker with physics-based E=hf swap fees. Pools are assigned spectral regions based on TVL (higher TVL = higher frequency = higher fees), with fairness safeguards including fee floor (0.1%) and cap (0.5%). Each swap calculates quantum energy and tracks total energy processed.
-   **DEX LP Farming System**: Physics-based yield farming using E=hf economics. Features 5 energy tiers (Gamma, X-Ray, UV, Visible, Infrared) based on electromagnetic spectrum. Higher TVL pools = higher frequency = more energy rewards. LP tokens are locked in escrow when staked to prevent reward extraction without liquidity backing.
-   **Validator Spectral Rewards**: Physics-based validator reward multipliers using E=hf principle. Validators are assigned spectral regions based on total stake (MICROWAVE 1.0x to GAMMA 1.5x). Spectral region updates automatically on all stake changes (delegation, slashing, registration). Real-time system health S(t) from NexusEngine displayed in staking UI.
