Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

### System Architecture

#### UI/UX Decisions
The application utilizes Streamlit for a single-page, wide-layout dashboard with an expanded sidebar for parameter configuration. Session state is used to manage simulation results, signal configurations, and parameter sets. Plotly provides interactive visualizations, including subplot-based time-series plots.

#### Technical Implementations
**Core Engine**: The `NexusEngine` implements the mathematical simulation, incorporating differential equations, feedback loops, multi-factor system health calculation, a PID controller, and dynamic issuance mechanisms. A Numba-optimized version (`NexusEngineNumba`) significantly improves performance for large-scale simulations.

**Data Storage**: SQLAlchemy ORM manages `SimulationConfig` for parameter sets and `SimulationRun` for simulation results, including time-series data stored as JSON.

**Signal Generation**: A Strategy pattern with a `SignalGenerator` class provides various signal types (constant, sinusoidal, step, random walk, pulse, linear ramp) for external inputs.

**Advanced Scenario Analysis**: Includes Monte Carlo Simulation for statistical distributions, Sensitivity Analysis for parameter importance, and Stability Region Mapping using 2D parameter space heatmaps.

**Multi-Agent Network Simulation**: Supports multi-node simulations with individual NexusEngines, various network topologies, inter-node value transfer via DAG-based optimization, and network influence mechanisms. It features sequential, DAG-optimized, and vectorized transaction processing modes.

Based on E=hc/λ (Planck-Einstein relation) and discrete electron energy levels. Fully integrated into Task Orchestration with workflow automation for encrypt, decrypt, and theory demonstration operations.

**Secure Messaging Integration**: Wavelength cryptography is integrated into the core communication system as advanced messaging handlers. The `CommunicationTaskHandlers` class now includes `send_wavelength_encrypted_message` and `decrypt_wavelength_message` operations, allowing secure message transmission via email, SMS, or in-app notifications. Secure messaging workflows are available in the Task Orchestration Core domain, enabling one-click encrypted communication with electromagnetic theory-based security. User-friendly compose interface with encryption key management, automated encrypt/decrypt workflows, and inbox for sent messages.

**User Guidance System**: Comprehensive informational tabs integrated throughout the application via `app_info_content.py`. Each major module includes "How to Use" guides with step-by-step instructions and "Documentation" sections explaining purpose and problem-solving. Help icons (ℹ️) provide quick access to guidance without cluttering the interface. "About NexusOS" page available for public display, presenting the platform's unified intelligence ecosystem. Guides cover Dashboard, Task Orchestration, Secure Messaging, Economic Simulator, and more.

**Layer 1 Blockchain Simulator**: Comprehensive mock blockchain simulation demonstrating all features needed for a successful Layer 1 chain. Features include multiple consensus mechanisms (Proof of Stake, Proof of Work, Byzantine Fault Tolerant, Delegated PoS), real-time transaction processing with mempool management, validator network with stake-weighted selection, and complete block lifecycle (creation, validation, execution). Includes visual stress testing with predefined scenarios: High TPS Load (5000+ TPS), Network Partition simulation, Validator Failures (40% failure rate), 51% Attack attempts, Combined Stress (multiple attack vectors), and Flash Crash events (15000 TPS + severe network disruption). Real-time visualization dashboard with network topology graph, performance metrics (TPS, block time, finality), validator status distribution, recent blocks table, and comprehensive chain statistics. Stress test scenarios demonstrate blockchain resilience under severe circumstances with visual presentation of network health, attack detection, and recovery mechanisms.

**Proof of Spectrum (PoS) Consensus - Phase 1 Foundation**: Wavelength-inspired blockchain consensus framework demonstrating spectral diversity principles for future Layer 1 development. Validators are assigned to spectral regions based on the electromagnetic spectrum (380-750nm), each using different cryptographic hash algorithms (SHA3-256, SHA3-512, BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s, SHA-512, SHA-256). Block validation concept requires signatures from multiple spectral regions combined through wave interference patterns. Current implementation provides theoretical foundation and visualization tools for exploring spectral quorum requirements. Future phases will integrate GhostDAG validator tracking, agent-based actor clustering, mobile network distribution, and full Layer 1 blockchain implementation with economic incentives. Wavelength-inspired digital implementation serves as conceptual framework for progressive development of production-ready consensus mechanism coupled with DAG optimization and mobile app ecosystem.

Validator reputation system scores performance based on uptime (50% weight), blocks proposed (30% weight), and slashing history. Economic modeling includes profitability calculator simulating daily/monthly/annual validator earnings, ROI projections, and APY calculations. Interactive delegation dashboard provides validator rankings by stake, delegation interface with reward estimates, personal delegation tracking with claim functionality, performance visualization charts, and profitability simulation tools.

Features include time-series forecasting with confidence intervals, trend detection (increasing, decreasing, stable, volatile), compound annual growth rate calculations, and multi-horizon predictions (1-5 years, 5-20 years, 20-50 years, 50-100 years). Strategic insight generation analyzes patterns to produce forward-thinking recommendations, identifies growth opportunities, detects risk factors, and supports long-term planning. ML-based pattern recognition with ensemble methods (moving average, exponential smoothing, polynomial trend extrapolation) provides robust predictions. Interactive visualization dashboard displays historical trends, predicted values with confidence bands, multi-metric comparison charts, trend distribution analysis, and strategic insight library. System designed to accumulate decades of critical data for quantifying prediction analysis and forward-thinking strategies.
