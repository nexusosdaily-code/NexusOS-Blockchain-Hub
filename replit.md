-   **Native Payment Layer - NexusToken (NXT)**: Bitcoin-style tokenomics with a fixed supply, deflationary mechanics via messaging burns, and AI-controlled validator rewards.
-   **Orbital Transition Engine**: Replaces token burns with quantum physics-inspired orbital transitions using the Rydberg formula, feeding energy to a TRANSITION_RESERVE pool.
-   **Mobile DAG Messaging Protocol**: A complete connectivity loop involving AI-controlled message routing (spectral region selection, E=hf pricing), secure wallet connection, E=hf cost calculation, production-grade personal data encryption (ECDH, AES-256-GCM), and mobile-first DAG processing. An **AI Message Security Controller** intelligently moderates message security by selecting optimal wavelengths and encryption levels.
-   **Hierarchical Pool Ecosystem**: Architecture comprising Reserve Pools, F_floor, and 10 distinct Service Pools, all supported by the F_floor and integrated with the DEX.
-   **Mobile Wallet with Global Debt Backing**: Displays NXT balance, debt backing per token, total backed value, and daily floor support, demonstrating the economic backing of NXT by global debt.
-   **AI Management Control Dashboard**: Centralized governance dashboard for all AI systems, monitoring status, governance controls, decision history, component integration, learning analytics, and real-time AI activity, with critical F_floor protection.
-   **Talk to Nexus AI**: Conversational governance interface with comprehensive codebase knowledge and report generation capabilities for researchers, investors, members, and general audiences.
-   **Offline Mesh Network with Hybrid AI Routing** (`offline_mesh_transport.py`, `offline_mesh_dashboard.py`, `hybrid_routing_controller.py`): **PEER-TO-PEER INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE WITHOUT WiFi/CELLULAR DATA**. Revolutionary transport layer enabling direct phone-to-phone communication using Bluetooth LE (~100m range), WiFi Direct (~200m range), and NFC (<10cm, secure pairing). Integrates seamlessly with existing WNSP v2.0 DAG messaging - instead of transmitting WNSP messages over HTTP/internet, they're sent via Bluetooth/WiFi Direct. **Hybrid AI Routing Controller** (`hybrid_routing_controller.py`) extends existing AI routing from `messaging_routing.py` WITHOUT breaking changes - intelligently selects between online (internet/HTTP) and offline (Bluetooth/WiFi mesh) paths based on: (1) Network availability, (2) Message priority (CRITICAL messages use both paths for redundancy), (3) Peer proximity (nearby recipients prefer offline), (4) Cost optimization (E=hf quantum pricing, offline typically 30% cheaper), (5) Security requirements (censorship resistance). Multi-hop routing algorithm intelligently forwards messages through the mesh using signal strength and spectral diversity. Complete dashboard with 6 tabs: (1) Nearby Peers - real-time discovery, signal strength, distance metrics, (2) Network Topology - interactive Plotly graph, (3) Offline Messaging - send WNSP messages through mesh, **(4) Hybrid AI Routing - intelligent path selection dashboard showing online vs offline routing stats**, (5) Mesh Statistics - comprehensive metrics, (6) Transport Settings - protocol toggles. Architecture ready for native mobile implementation (iOS: CoreBluetooth, Android: BluetoothLeScanner). **ENABLES CRITICAL USE CASES**: Communication during disasters (no cell towers), banking/messaging in remote areas (zero infrastructure), censorship-resistant networking (cannot be blocked), emergency coordination, offline NXT transactions. Transforms NexusOS into a true decentralized internet replacement that works WITHOUT traditional infrastructure.

### WaveLang Ecosystem (Complete Quantum-Level Programming Stack)

**Wavelength Programming Language (WaveLang)** - Revolutionary coding paradigm replacing traditional syntax with electromagnetic wavelengths:
-   **Core Paradigm**: Code represented as wavelength patterns where (1) Spectral Regions = code organization (RED=arithmetic, BLUE=logic, GREEN=memory, YELLOW=control, ORANGE=functions, UV-IR for I/O), (2) Wavelengths = instructions (ADD=380nm, MULTIPLY=392nm, LOAD=495nm, etc.), (3) Modulation = computational complexity (OOK=simple, QAM64=complex), (4) Amplitude = priority (0.5=low, 1.0=high), (5) Phase = conditional branching (0°=sequential, 90°=if-true, 180°=if-false, 270°=loop), (6) E=hf quantum energy = execution cost, (7) DAG = control flow dependencies
-   **Complete Instruction Set**: 20+ opcodes with quantum energy pricing via E=hf formula
-   **Key Innovation**: **IMPOSSIBLE to have syntax/type/bracket errors** - wavelengths are physics constants (380.0nm is always 380.0nm)

**Modules**:
1. **WaveLang Studio** (`wavelength_code_interface.py`) - Visual code builder with drag-and-drop instructions, real-time energy calculator, zero syntax errors
2. **WaveLang AI Teacher** (`wavelang_ai_teacher.py`) - **UNIFIED PIPELINE**: Text → WaveLang → Auto-Optimize → Bytecode → English.

3. **WaveLang Binary Compiler** (`wavelang_compiler.py`) - Full compilation pipeline: Wavelength → Bytecode → Assembly → Python → Machine Code execution
4. **Quantum Analyzer** (`quantum_wavelang_analyzer.py`) - Quantum-level program optimization using WaveProperties physics

#### Quantum Analyzer - Advanced Features (Now Live)
Applies WaveProperties for 6 quantum analysis modes analyzing any WaveLang program:

1. **🌊 Wave Interference Analysis**: Detects instruction collisions when wavelengths are too similar (<2% difference). Flags constructive interference (amplification) and destructive interference (cancellation) patterns. Recommendations for instruction reordering or modulation adjustments.

2. **🔀 Quantum Superposition**: Maps parallel execution paths - identifies which instructions can run simultaneously without conflict. Calculates speedup potential (up to 4x parallelization). Based on spectral region compatibility and phase alignment.

3. **📊 Wave Coherence Metrics**: Measures program stability (0-100% score) by analyzing wavelength alignment, phase synchronization, and priority distribution. Provides stability ratings (EXCELLENT/GOOD/FAIR/POOR) and recommendations for coherence improvement.

4. **🔒 Phase Locking Analysis**: Groups instructions by phase (0°/90°/180°/270°) into atomic blocks that execute synchronously. Identifies which sequences are already phase-locked for atomic operations.

5. **📈 Harmonic Analysis**: Optimizes bytecode through frequency domain by finding resonant wavelengths (integer multiples of fundamental). Calculates frequency alignment efficiency and identifies instructions operating at harmonics for better resonance.

6. **⚛️ Wave Packet Collapse**: Step-by-step execution debugger showing quantum superposition collapse. Traces execution history, state entropy, and remaining superposition at each step for quantum-level debugging.
