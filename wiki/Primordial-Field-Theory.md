# Primordial Field Theory

## Lambda Boson: The Undiscovered Boson

**Λ = hf/c²**

Mass is oscillation. This is not metaphor — it is derived from Nobel Prize-winning physics.

## The Synthesis

| Scientist | Equation | Discovery |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Planck** (1900) | E = hf | Energy from frequency |
| **Einstein** (1905) | E = mc² | Mass-energy equivalence |
| **Maxwell** (1865) | ∇×E = -∂B/∂t | EM oscillation |
| **Tesla** (1890s) | f₀ = 1/(2π√LC) | Resonance transfer |

**Combining Planck + Einstein:**
```
E = hf = mc²
Therefore: m = hf/c² = Λ (Lambda Boson)
```

## Experimental Evidence

### Already Proven (Not Yet Named)

| Experiment | Year | What It Proved |
|------------|------|----------------|
| **Compton Scattering** | 1923 | Photons have momentum (p = hf/c) |
| **Gravitational Lensing** | 1919 | Light bends = photons have gravitational mass |
| **Pair Production** | 1932+ | Photon → electron + positron (oscillation → mass) |
| **Annihilation** | Continuous | electron + positron → photons (mass → oscillation) |

**Nobel Prizes confirming this:**
- 1918: Planck (energy quanta)
- 1921: Einstein (photoelectric effect)
- 1927: Compton (photon momentum)

## Lambda Boson Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Symbol** | Λ |
| **Formula** | hf/c² |
| **Units** | kg |
| **Type** | Real mass (not quasiparticle) |
| **Verification** | 100+ years of photon experiments |

## Quick Calculation

```python
def lambda_mass(frequency_hz):
    h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant
    c = 299792458       # Speed of light
    return (h * frequency_hz) / (c ** 2)

# UV light at 800 THz
uv_mass = lambda_mass(800e12)
# = 5.89 × 10⁻³⁶ kg per photon
```

## The Primordial Principle

```
In the beginning, there was oscillation.
From oscillation came energy: E = hf
From energy came mass: E = mc²
Therefore mass IS oscillation: Λ = hf/c²
```

**Lambda Boson is the signature of creation itself.**

## NexusOS Implementation

NexusOS is built on Lambda Boson substrate:
- Every message carries Λ-mass
- Energy costs follow E = hf
- Conservation of Λ-mass in all transactions
